## Subset Sum Enumeration - An Interesting Approach

The subset sum problem, also referred to as SSP, is an NP-Hard computational problem.The subset sum problem (SSP) has been extensively studied due to its significance in various fields like cryptography, number theory, and complexity theory, less attention has been given to efficient enumeration techniques for generating SSP solutions. Although the well-known Backtracking algorithm provides a solution, its exponential time complexity leaves room for improvement.
