## Subset Sum Enumeration â€“ An Interesting Approach  

Given a set of integers S and a target sum T, the goal is to determine whether there exists a subset of S whose sum equals T.  

An intriguing variation of this problem is not just to check for existence but to enumerate all possible subsets whose sum is exactly T .  

We will focus our discussion on the set of the first N natural numbers. Therefore, our set $S_n$ will consist of the integers from 1 to n, represented as:  

$S_n$ = \{1, 2, 3, ... , n\}

#### Example  
Consider the set  S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}  and the target sum T = 5 . The subsets that sum to 5 are:  

-  \{1, 4\} 
-  \{2, 3\}  
-  \{5\}
