About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m Zaid, a final year student at IIIT Hyderabad pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. My academic and professional interests span Computer Systems, Programming Languages, Machine Learning, and Data Structures & Algorithms.

### Internship Experience  

During my internship at **D.E. Shaw & Co.** in Hyderabad, I worked with the **Python Infrastructure Team**team to improve testing systems. I built an automated test coverage framework using **GCOV** that helped monitor our critical C/C++ infrastructure libraries. Using LibClang's AST parser for code analysis and fastcov for tests coverage information, I helped increase our testing coverage substantially.The AST-based analysis let us find untested code paths and understand function dependencies better, which made our testing process more efficient.
